          <h3> Tips To Help You Get On Your Mat Everyday </h3>
          <ul>
          <li>1.) Go with a friend! Everything is better with your best friend, right? </li>
          <li>2.) Track your progress. Take pictures, write down how you feel afterwards. What poses were easy for you, do you feel you get better sleep after yoga? </li>
          <li>3.) Practice postures that are difficult for you. Motivate yourself into wanting to be able to achieve that dancer pose that almost seems impossible.</li>
          <li>4.) Switch up your routine! Try a new sequence, test out a new instructor. It's always great to meet new people and expand yourself into other types of practice.</li>
          <li>5.) Most importantly, reward yourself. Celebrate your successes when you achieve a goal.</li>
        </ul>


          <p>"Yoga is not about being bendy. It ‘s about showing up to your mat consistently not
            knowing what is going to happen and being okay with that. It’ s about rehabilitating
            yourself and not believing the “experts” when they say you are too injured or too old.
            It’s about believing that you can do anything even if it’s the most scariest impossible
            thing you could ever dream of.  It’s about uncovering who your really are.  It’s about
            being kind to yourself so that you can then be kind to others.  Yoga is about discovering
            that most of the crazy thoughts in your head are not true.  It’s about being healthy
            without pushing yourself to your limit.  It’s about slowing down to get strong.  It’s
            about breathing and moving and smiling on the inside.  It’s the hardest thing I have
            ever done, but also the best." -Unknown</p>
