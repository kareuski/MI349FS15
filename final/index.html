				<h2> Welcome! </h2>
					Live & Yoga is a community designed to inspire others by the practice of yoga and
					to help you live the healthiest, happiest life possible. I want to have an atmosphere
					of sharing health and wellness tips. Yogis are like-minded individuals that offer wisdom,
					share their advice and grow together. Everyone is having a unique earthly experience.
					Everything is you and your projections of your perception. I urge you to flow through
					the site, try new things, find balance and most importantly enjoy your own unique journey.
					Enjoy loves, sending you many thanks for visiting my site!
